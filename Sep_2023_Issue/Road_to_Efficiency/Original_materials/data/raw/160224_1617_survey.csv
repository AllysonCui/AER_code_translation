Comment,Cool experiment. Mad at the person who chose 5 though,,No,,,Easy and clear experiment. Thanks!,,1 minute time period can be shortened,,Very frustrating when the obvious choice for the most money was for everyone to choose 7 and people kept changing their answer to make others wary. Did not understand why they would willingly give themselves less money.,all the participants have no incentive to change  as they want max money. but i feel like it could be designed in  a better way so that it would be funny to see how people change,Instructions were very easy to follow. Thank you!\r\n
