Comment,,,,I wish everyone has taken a game theory class. There was no reason to pick anything but 7 unless I assume other people didn't think this through.,"This game felt easy to understand which made it confusing--like the confusing instructions were a mislead, but if every single person  chooses 7 every time, you get the largest payout and so does everyone else.",
