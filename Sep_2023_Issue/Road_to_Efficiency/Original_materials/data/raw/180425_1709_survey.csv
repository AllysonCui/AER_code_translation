Comment,,,,,,It is an interesting experiment that tests how people buld trust with each other. i think the reason why everyone is so quickly agree on to choose 7 is because the difference between each option is not that big. So just quite ,,,60 seconds is way too long for a decision period. The solution for earning the highest possible amount of payoff seems incredibly simple if all players thoroughly understand the concept. ,,,
Comment 1,,,,,,indifferent between choose 7 or 6 ,,,,,,
