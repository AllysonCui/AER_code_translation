Comment,,great study! The paper handouts could be more clear (colors and lines) and I believe there were some grammatical errors in the write-up. ,,complicated the instructions. The game is actually pretty straight forward.,"I was confused why, during one of the rounds, someone opted to pick 6 (making them the lowest number and forcing everyone else to pick 6 as well in order to receive 1.14 instead of 1.10) when the payoff was highest when everone ","For the last round, I kept clicking to change my number but the graph did not change to reflect the switch (even though I had 5 revision opportunities before the graph eventually changed -- indicated by 5 dots on my line)",,,,Very interesting! Thank you!,na,
Comment 1,,,,,picked 7? Otherwise very straightforward. Thanks!,,,,,,,
