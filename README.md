# American Economic Review Code Translation

## Overview & Objectives
This repo contains the publicly available replication materials from the September 2023 and October 2023 Issues of the American Economic Review (with the exception of one article per issue because the replication packages are "temporarily" unavailable). 

The goal of this project is to figure out if there are errors in the STATA code by translating the replication code provided into R or Python and then comparing the human translated code to the same code translated by LLMs. We want to find out if we need to translate code, like we translate languages and how LLMs can help us with this translation process. Furthermore, in some languages there is a specific word that encompasses a whole set of feelings/actions which cannot be directly translated into English - there are a number of Japanese words like this and the word “hygge” from Danish is another example. Is this same inability to directly translate words the case with code and LLMs?

## Repo Structure

## Instructions

Clearly label the translated code documents with your name and identify issues you discovered and fixed during the translation process.
